    Role to configure a production server baseline for personal projects.
    Works in conjunction with the runtime_setup role: while each role performs distinct tasks,
    they complement and depend on each other to fully configure a Node.js API, Apache, Caddy as a reverse proxy,
    auditd, and related services. This role handles security services, log rotation for system and application logs,
    and basic hardening of SSH, AppArmor, UFW, Fail2ban, Apache, PHP-FPM, MySQL, Node.js API, Caddy, and Cloudflare Tunnel.
    Intended for personal use; while functional, it is in testing and not guaranteed to be production-ready.
