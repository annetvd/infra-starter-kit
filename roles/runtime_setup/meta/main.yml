  description: >
    Role to finalize the runtime setup of personal projects on a production server.
    Depends on the security role, which installs and configures the base services.
    This role configures services such as the Node.js API, Apache, and Caddy as a reverse proxy,
    and sets up auditd rules for the system and services managed by the security role.
    Service files are not provisioned by this role and must be deployed separately, allowing flexibility
    to use different deployment methods according to project-specific needs.
    It focuses on runtime initialization and service orchestration rather than installation.
    Intended for personal use; functional but in testing, not guaranteed to be production-ready.
